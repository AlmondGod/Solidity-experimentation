Design Choices:

Token Sale Contract:

Phased Sale: Differentiates presale and public sale with distinct timeframes.
Contribution Limits: Implements caps and individual contribution limits for balanced distribution.
Dynamic Handling: Adjusts excess contributions and refunds to maintain caps.
Security: Uses nonReentrant for transaction security and Ownable for owner-exclusive functions.
Token Distribution: Distributes tokens immediately upon contribution.
Refund Mechanism: Allows refunds if minimum caps aren't met.
Controlled Phases: Owner-managed functions to transition between sale phases.

Security Considerations
- Inherits from Ownable for secure ownership management, ensuring that only the contract owner can access critical functions.
- Follows this pattern, particularly in functions like buyTokens and claimRefund, to prevent reentrancy attacks.
- Includes necessary checks for zero addresses, valid timeframes, and sufficient balances, reducing the risk of errors and misuse.
- Events like TokensPurchased and RefundClaimed provide transparency and traceability for important contract activities.

Decentralized Voting:

Owner Management: Utilizes arrays and mappings for efficient owner tracking and validation.
Transaction Structure: Stores transactions with details and confirmation status in structs.
Confirmation Mechanism: Dynamic confirmation count and flexible requirement setting.
Access Control: Uses modifiers for function access and validation.
Lifecycle Management: Functions for submitting, confirming, revoking, and executing transactions.

Security Considerations

- The contract follows this pattern, especially in executeTransaction, to avoid reentrancy attacks.
- Only wallet owners can submit, confirm, execute, or revoke transactions, and the contract checks that transactions exist and are not already executed before any critical operation.
- Once set in the constructor, the list of owners and the confirmation threshold cannot be changed. This decision enhances security but lacks flexibility in modifying ownership.
- The contract emits events for all critical actions, providing transparency and auditability.


Token Swap Contract:

Token Interface: Implements IERC20 for ERC-20 standard compatibility.
Two-Token Model: Handles specific token pair with a fixed exchange rate.
Swap Functions: Separate functions for each swap direction.
Balance Checks: Ensures user balance and allowance sufficiency.
Liquidity Verification: Checks contract's token balance before swaps.
Event Logging: Emits events for swap transparency.

Security Considerations

- The contract does not explicitly use a reentrancy guard, but the nature of ERC-20 transferFrom function calls mitigates the risk of reentrancy. However, explicitly including a reentrancy guard could further bolster security.
- The contract performs necessary checks on the input amounts and token balances to prevent erroneous or malicious transactions.
- By adhering to the ERC-20 standard and using OpenZeppelin's trusted implementations, the contract avoids common pitfalls in token handling


Multi-Signature Wallet:

Initialization: Sets up owners and confirmation threshold at deployment.
Transaction Structure: Transaction details and confirmations in structs.
Modifiers: Implements onlyOwner and transaction state checks.
Transaction Functions: For submission, confirmation, execution, and revocation.
Event Emission: Logs actions for auditability.

Security Considerations

- Reentrancy Guard: The contract does not directly interact with unknown contracts except for the `executeTransaction` function, where reentrancy attacks are mitigated by setting the transaction to executed before the external call.
- No Iteration Over Owners: The contract avoids loops over the owners array to prevent potential gas limit issues.
- Validations: The contract checks for zero addresses, ensures unique owners, and validates the number of confirmations required.
- Control Over External Calls: Only executed transactions can make external calls, and these are initiated by the owners.
